INSTALLATION
This 64-bit Windows version of CEPS is publicly available for free, non-commercial use at https://bitbucket.org/deepak_panday/pipeline/src/pipeline_V2/. No subscription is required. The complete download will take xxxx MB of disk space. A User Manual and a Primer on complexity and entropy are included in the download as *.pdf files. MATLAB must be installed (but not necessarily open) before use. To run CEPS, go to the downloaded ‘scripts’ folder and click on the file ProcessData_App.mlapp [rename]. MATLAB will then open, followed by CEPS. The CEPS Manual and Primer are accessible via a HELP button in the GUI, as are a feedback form and a link to the latest version of the software.
