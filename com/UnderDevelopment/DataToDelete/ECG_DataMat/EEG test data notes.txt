These are EEG files with 19 channels of 'raw' time series data, in rows 1-19, approximately 300 seconds long. They have not been cleaned of artefact.

Many of our measures will only be valid for epochs (4-second epochs, for example), because of stationarity issues. 
You can test the data for stationarity using the Cheynet tests in the GUI.
