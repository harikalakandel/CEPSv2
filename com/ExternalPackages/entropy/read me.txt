The functions include extensive Shannon and nonextensive Tsallis,escort Tsallis,and renyi entropy.
the funcition names start with K_q_ indicate relative entropys
Usage for all the seven functions:

if we assume DATA to be a matrix by M*N  . 
then the format should be sum(DATA(:,i))=1,for i=1:N, and N is the length of the time series
