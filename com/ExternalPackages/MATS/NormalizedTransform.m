function yV = NormalizedTransform(xV)
% xM = NormalizedTransform(xV)
% NORMALIZEDTRANSFORM takes a time series 'xV' and transform it linearly to
% a time series with zero mean and one standard deviation. 
% INPUTS:
% - xV      : vector of a scalar time series
% OUTPUTS:
% - yV      : a vector of equal size.
